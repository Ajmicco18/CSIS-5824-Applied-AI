# CSIS-5824-Applied-AI

This repository contains projects from my Applied Artificial Intelligence course.

## TAME Individual Project

The TAME Individual Project contains the code I used to create the UML diagrams and the implementation code. The idea of the project is to create a tropistic agent that uses a Vernier Sensor to measure the salinity of a water or soil sample and a model based reflex agent that uses the measurement to provide an evaluation on the soil or water sample.

- ### UML Documents
The UML diagrams folder contains the code I used to create a Use-Case Diagram, a Class Representation Diagram, a State Diagram and a Deployment Diagram for both of the project's agents.\

- ### TAME_project 
The TAME Project Code folder contains two .cpp files, two .h files and an .ino file that I used to implement the agents' functionality. 

- ### arduino_practice
This folder contains a .ino file where I ran code to become familiar with using an Arduino as well as the Arduino IDE.
