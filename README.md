# CSIS-5824-Applied-AI\

# This repository contains projects from my Applied Artificial Intelligence course\

# The TAME Individual Project contains the code I used to create the UML diagrams and the implementation code. The idea of the project is to create a tropistic agent that uses a Vernier Sensor to measure the salinity of a water or soil sample and a model based reflex agent that uses the measurement to provide an evaluation on the soil or water sample.\

# UML Diagrams\
# The UML diagrams folder contains the code I used to create a Use-Case Diagram, a Class Representation Diagram, a State Diagram and a Deployment Diagram for both of the project's agents.\

#TAME Project Code\
# The TAME Project Code folder contains two .cpp files, two .h files and an .ino file that I used to implement the agents' functionality.
